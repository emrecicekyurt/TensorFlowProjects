# TensorFlowProjects
## TensorFlow Projects and Workspace

It is a representative repository that reflects the knowledge that I gained during learning Deep Learning with TensorFlow. Also, This repository has been prepared by considering the course that "TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery" provided in Udemy. 

## Here is the things that this repo provides to you

* Learn to pass Google's official **TensorFlow Developer Certificate** exam (and add it to your resume)
* Build TensorFlow models using Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing
* Complete access to ALL interactive notebooks and ALL course slides as downloadable guides
* Increase your skills in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to test your abilities with the TensorFlow assessment exam
* Understand how to integrate Machine Learning into tools and applications
* Learn to build all types of Machine Learning Models using the latest TensorFlow 2
* Build image recognition, object detection, text recognition algorithms with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks
* Using real world images to visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy
* Applying Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting
* Gain the skills you need to become a TensorFlow Certified Developer
* Be recognized as a top candidate for recruiters seeking TensorFlow developers
